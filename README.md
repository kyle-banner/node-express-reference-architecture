This repository uses TypeORM. The ormconfig file contains secrets, it has been marked ignored in .gitignore. You'll need to get this ormconfig.json file from a team member. Any time an entity is updated a new migration must be created/updated. More on migrations here: https://typeorm.io/#/migrations.
